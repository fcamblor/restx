# RESTX Extension Points

## Intro

Restx Dependency injection allows to easily write plugins extending some key extension points.

This page is intended to describe how to change or improve some RESTX behaviours.

## RESTX Session cookie names

app.name & RestxCookieDescriptor

## Writing your own RESTX Given statements

... and Recorder too !
I think it will need a dedicated page.

## Overriding Admin Console security

We should grab some content from [ref-security](ref-security.html) and put it here

## Providing new Object deserializers (`StringConverters`)

## Overriding Jackson `ObjectMapper`

## Adding new RESTX Server implementations

## Enhancing RESTX Shell

## Using another Bean validation implementation (than `Hibernate Validator`)
